# Fresh Crypto 

## Intro
Description of project - decrypting QText documents the passcode to which has been lost
Short blog post describing the process of reversing and attacking the fairly weak encryption mechanism.
A lot of the tools (Unpackers, IDA Free) and knowledge used had barely survived to this day.

## Getting started - QText
DOSBOX is our go to emulator
Screenshots of software, early conclusions on form of crypto
* Passcode is short - 4 characters and limited to uppercase characters and numbers - very small keyspace
* Header is added to encrypted files - same passcode == same header - is it the encryption key?
* 16 byte key (TODO - add vimdiff of hexdump of two file headers) is included in header - no actual secret
* Per line encryption, per column values (show line of `'aaaa'`s encrypted, as well as line of `'a a '`s

The key may be included in the file, but we don't know the encryption mechanism. 
We could try and reverse it, but brute-forcing is feasible and simpler in this case - if we have a fast way to test the passcodes. 
Assuming (quite safely) that the 16 byte "key" is derived from the passcode - we can try to reverse engineer the key derivation algorithm - which we first confirmed was not any well known hash function.

## Reversing MS-DOS binaries
MS-DOS era binaries - not quite PE, but does start with MZ
Reminder about flat memory space - 16 bits, segmentation

### PKZip
File recognizes it as PKZip packed SFX - self extracting executable.
PKWare is responsible for the popularity of the ZIP file format as we know it today
But it was also responsible for a widely used executable packer in the MS-DOS age.

There isn't any readily available information about PKZip - presumably it utilized the same compression algorithm as the normal zip utility,
but we were struggling to find a tool that would properly unpack the SFX to a plain executable.

Having failed to find additional information about this packer, and wanting to avoid reverse engineering the unpacker stub - 
We tried to use the DOSBOX debuggers CPU LOG feature to step past the unpacker code, sometime after the original entry point - and then extract the code from memory.

While this did work, it only accounted for a small part of the code - the executable was TODO in size and we could only see one segment of code executing at that time.

Recalling older days of reversing crackmes (though not as old as this program) reminded me that there used to be a host of generic unpacker tools, the working of which 
were often mysterious - but generally speaking they did the job.
Eventually we found the following TODO blog post which guided me to the the legendary reverse engineering relic - exetools.

The unpacker page had a huge amount of unpackers, we assume a lot of them would have done the job as PKZip was fairly common, but we first tried
the one called PKUNLITE, and when that didn't work (but looked promising) - DISLITE v1.15

TODO - screenshots of both tools running


### int 3f - MS-DOS Overlays
Loading the binary in IDA Free 5.0 (which luckily is still in distribution - hosted at the ScummVM website) showed that the executable utilized
dynamic overlay linking - likely Turbo Pascal overlays.
Overlays were the solution to the limited 16bit memory space. The overlay mechanism was essentially an implementation of page swapping in user-space - 
The executable was accompanied by an .ovr file which contained additional code (in this case, a LOT of additional code)
The root code (which originates from the .exe file) was always mapped into memory, while segments of the overlay were mapped into memory selectively.
Calls between overlays (and the root segment) occured through a jump table.
If the overlay was already mapped into memory, the stub simply led to its location.
Otherwise, it led to (in this case) `int 3f` instruction accompanied by the overlay metadata - which contained among other things the file offset of the relevant code segment.
The interrupt handler would then map the relevant overlay into memory, in place of another overlay, and fix up the stubs, before resuming execution.

TODO - screenshot of overlay metadata

IDA does an excellent job in flattening and statically linking the stubs so we can reverse engineer the program in its entirety, but this presented a challenge for us 
in dynamically debugging the code, since while the root segment were always loaded into the same memory area, the overlays would change location very often, making it impossible
for us to place breakpoints properly.
Dredging up information about the Turbo Pascal overlay system was difficult, and the DOSBOX debugger did not explicitly support stepping out of the interrupt.
It's likely that we could have reverse engineering the interrupt handler and found a place to break in right before resuming program execution in the newly loaded overlay,
but we eventually opted for a simpler solution - finding an overlay-to-root call that we could break on and then step out into the newly loaded overlay.
This is slightly arduous but for the fairly short task at hand it would work, and we had ample overlay-to-root calls to break on since the root segment hosted a lot of
Turbo Pascal standard functions.


## Key expansion function
### Tracing through passcode flow
Finding the key expansion function took some reversing and a lot of tracing.
Our initial idea was perform hot spot analysis by using DOSBOX's CPU log command to trace execution while repeatedly failing the passcode check on a locked document.
TODO - add screenshot of failed passcode check

Eventually we went for a more direct approach and simply placed a breakpoint on the `int 21` interrupt handler to catch open and read calls
TODO - add debugger picture, correct int 21 params

We traced through an open on the document path and a read of 0x1d bytes - which is the exact size of the header we saw in locked documents.
Continuing with dynamic debugging, we pinpointed a function that takes the entered passcode string and the 0x1d header as parameters.

Digging in, we see how the the passcode is passed into an internal function, and the result is compared to the header.

TODO - add IDA screen shot of main function, and of pascal string compare call

Presumably, the function at TODO performs key expansion.

### Key derivation function
The passcode is first passed through a permutation function which iteratively increments each byte of the passcode by the sum of all bytes in the string.
Before proceeding to the byte in the next position, a certain predicate is tested by using the value of the resulting byte as an index into a static bitmap - where each bit represents whether or not
that byte value is valid (1) or not (0). Similar to CFG!

If the value is invalid - it is incremented by 0x22 - which in the case of our immutable bitmap - is always enough to push it into the valid value range.
TODO - screen shot of bitmap

Concretely, this can be represented by simply checking if 0x21 < value < 0xff TODO :shrug:

After that, the string is concatenated to itself (in place) 3 times, and passed through the permutation function again.

The result of this is indeed the key as it appears in the header.

P(x) - permutation function
i -> len of x
j -> len of x
k[i] = k[i] + k[j]

K = P(P(passcode) | P(passcode) | P(passcode) | P(passcode))

Now we can brute-force the passcode which has a very small input space very quickly.
However, with our new-found knowledge of the key derivation function, we can try to reverse it for an even quicker solution.

## Reversing the key derivation
Let's first examine a simple case - the result of permutating a simple two character string - '00':

$$ P(\text{'00'}) = P(\text{'\x30\x30'}) = \text{'\x90\x80'} $$



The permutation in two bytes (we'll omit the "forbidden" byte range for now) can also be described as:

$$
\begin{array}{l|ll}
        \text{input bytes} &a_1, &a_2 \\
        \text{step 1} &a_1 + a_1 + a_2, &a_2  \\
        \text{step 2} &a_1 + a_1 + a_2, &a_2 + (a_1 + a_1 + a_2) + (a_2 + (a_1 + a_1 + a_2)) \\
        P(\text{input bytes})&\color{olive}{2a_1 + a_2}, &2(a_2 + (\color{olive}{2a_1 + a_2}) \\
        P(\text{'00'})&\mathrm{\color{olive}{0x90}}, &\mathrm{0x80}
\end{array}
$$

The permutation only involves combinations of our input values - so it's linear, but it isn't strictly linear - we lose the carry bit in any operation that overflows $$0xFF$$. 

Let's say we want to reverse the permutation - starting from the last byte.
We know that $$\color{olive}{2a_1 + a_2}$$ evaluted to $$\mathrm{\color{olive}{0x90}}$$, so we can substitute for it:

$$
2(a_2 + (\color{olive}{2a_1 + a_2}) = \mathrm{0x80} \pmod{0xFF} \\
2(a_2 + (\color{olive}{0x90}) = \mathrm{0x80} \pmod{0xFF}
$$

But now, since we have to divide by 2 (which is not invertible in this field) - there are two possible solutions:

$$
\begin{align}
    &a_2 + \color{olive}{0x90} = \mathrm{0x40} \pmod{0xFF} \tag{case 1} \\
    &a_2 + \color{olive}{0x90} = \mathrm{0xc0} \pmod{0xFF} \tag{case 2} \\
    \\
    &a_2 = \color{red}{0xb0} \tag{case 1} \\
    &a_2 = \color{green}{0x30} \tag{case 2}
\end{align}
$$

We happen to know that the correct value here is 0x30, but generally speaking when trying to invert the permutation function we'll have to superimpose both results.
Simply put - at each step of the decomposition process, we "split" into two branches - one for each result.

n addition, for a certain range of values, another split occurs, due to the 
If the given value is +0x22 from any of the "forbidden" byte values, we don't know if that value was arrived at naturally, or the corresponding forbidden value was the 
result of the final step of the addition, and was then followed by correction by 0x22 bytes.
Luckily, none of the forbidden values lead to double corrections as their range only spans 0x21 TODO ?? bytes.

This means that we branch out between once and twice at each byte. For 16 bytes, that means between $$2^{16}$$ and $$2^{17}$$ branches, which isn't too bad, but luckily there
are a couple of constraints that help us out in minimizing the search space.

### Reversing the first stage - 4 bytes to 4 printable characters
The first constraint is pretty straightforward - any final byte has to be a printable character.


### Reversing the second stage - 16 bytes to $$4\times4$$ byte strings
The second constraint isnt as trivial, but is still pretty simple - the format of the 16 byte key before getting clobbered is 4 bytes repeating 4 times.
That means we only have to decompose 4 bytes - and then re-feed those 4 bytes through the expansion network to see if we receive the original key.

That narrows our search space down to 2**5 for each step - or 2**6 in total.
